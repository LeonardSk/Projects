## Exploratory Data Analysis on US Building Permits data
  - The purpose of this exercise is to explore and visualise US Building permit data, and to form a view on some of the long term trends with the help of basic detrending modelling techniques.
  - Some trivial (but crucial) R techniques used here include :
    - dplyr for slicing and dicing the data
    - ggplot for visualisations
    - Simple linear regression + nesting data and mapping
