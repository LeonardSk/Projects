## Exploratory Data Analysis on US Building Permits data
  - The purpose of this exercise is to explore and visualise US Building permit data, and to form a view on some of the long term trends with the help of basic detrending modelling techniques.
  - Some trivial (but crucial) R techniques used here include :
    - dplyr for slicing and dicing the data
    - ggplot for visualisations
    - Simple linear regression + nesting data and mapping

## A Playaround with TidyModels (with Pima Indians Diabetes data)
   - Details of the data can be found <a href="http://math.furman.edu/~dcs/courses/math47/R/library/mlbench/html/PimaIndiansDiabetes.html">here</a>
   - This is to explore the implementation of ML techniques using TidyModels
   - My personal go-to package in the past was Caret, but given the ease of integration of TidyModels into the Tidyverse (esp with pipe operators and purrr), it is certainly worth the transition. 
   - This is simply a quick and dirty play-around of TidyModel's key features and functionalities, stay tuned for more refined projects in the future.
